### EconergyCalc - Household Energy Consumption Calculator

## üìç Introduction
This project is done for the ENSE 405: Designing Apps for Learning and Collaboration class in the Fall 2023 Semester under the supervision of Dr. Tim Maciag. This project aims to explore the design and development of community-focused software to enhance collaboration and learning aligned with one or more of the 17 UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and engage in creating digital habitats for specific communities, blending new software engineering processes with your prior academic and work experiences.

## ‚òëÔ∏è UN SDG(s)
- **Goal 7**: Ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all
- **Goal 11**: Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable

## üí° Project idea
This project aims to build an interactive web application where users can add or log the electrical appliances they use regularly in their household and receive their total energy consumption. The application will also provide users with weekly/yearly energy consumption predictions and give actionable recommendations, such as providing more sustainable or eco-friendly alternatives for appliances that use more energy than they should.

## üß≠ Project background/Business Opportunity
In line with UN Sustainable Development Goals 7 (Affordable and Sustainable Energy) and 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities), this project addresses the pressing global challenge of household energy consumption. As urbanization continues to rise, energy consumption in residential areas is a critical concern. The project aims to create an innovative web application that empowers individuals to make informed decisions about their energy use, ultimately contributing to reduced carbon emissions and more sustainable living. As traditional energy sources are often non-renewable and contribute to environmental degradation and climate change, many individuals need more awareness of their energy usage patterns and the ecological impact of their appliances. The project aims to empower individuals to make informed choices about their energy consumption, promoting sustainable living and, as a result, contributing to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and environmental impact.
